# Ableton User Library ðŸ‘»ðŸ‘»


This repositoriey is my place to host my Ableton User Library presets.
If you have purchased Toybox Bundle and Toybox Nano Packs these presets will work for you. (They should all work with Nano and Free Pack from Toybox)
Theses presets basically are all the oscilators and effects individually pre wired up for faster drag and drop preformace.
So far there is 204 presets between the Instrument Racks and Audio Effects Rack folders. Just drag and drop into your Ableton User Library folder.
If you like these presets and want more just send me an email.
Nano 3 presets are being added please check back for further updates.
Also presets for the floor shakers pack are being updated too.
Excited to announce all presets are being updated to version 2.0 also, adding NKSR format to all of my presets as well.
Progress + = :)

70 presets createed, 140 changes 4/24/2022
